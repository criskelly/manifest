		<h1>ABOUT THE MANIFEST</h1>
		<div id="about">
			<p>The Manifest came about because I was tired of being a touring independent musician and NOT being able to find musicians in other cities to co-bill with. I know there are websites that offer searches, but you generally need a profile to use them - and the other musicians need to have a profile also. And how many more profiles do I need as a musician?</p>
			<p>So I was talking with my friend Matt - a fellow musician, and he shared the frustration. We thought that a single comprehensive listing of cities in the US and Canada would be awesome. That way, we wouldn't need to log in to anything, or create another profile; we would be able to plan a tour, look up the cities on this site, and connect with musicians in those cities. Bam. That's it. That's all we needed. But it didn't exist.</p> 
			<p>That conversation was in 2008. In 2011, I went back to school for web development. Having just completed my certificate at PSU, I realized that I now had all the skills to build a site like the one we talked about. So I did. This is it.</p>
			<!-- <p>After I created the site, I realized that it can also be extremely useful for event planners, wedding planners, music festivals, cruise ships - anyone looking for musicians in a specific region. I mean, if I live in Portland, Oregon, and I'm getting married in St. Cloud, Minnesota...how do I find musicians in St. Cloud? Or if I'm hosting a corporate event in Idyllwild, California? Google can only help me so much.</p> -->
			<p>Eventually, I'm hoping that this site will expand to Europe, Japan, SE Asia - everywhere in the world that independent musicians tour without big sponsors. Setting up one's own tour is hard enough...and finding local musicians to connect with is one of the keys to making the tour successful.</p>
			<p>So, cheers to all the indie artists in the world. Let's get together, and feel all right!</p>
